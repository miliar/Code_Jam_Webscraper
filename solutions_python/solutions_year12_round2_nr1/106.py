    worst case for contestant #i:
    lowest score (not me) gets all votes I don't

    If I get y, my score is score[i] + y*x
    Threshold score is  low + (1-y)*x
    My margin is   score +y*x - low - (1-y)*x >=0
    score - low + y*x - x + y*x >=0
    score - low -x >= -2yx
    (score - low - x)/(-2x) <= y

    but...
    If there are ties for the lowest score, then they all have
    to divide the remaining 1-y

    score +y*x >= low + (1-y)*x /count
    y*x + y*x/count >= low - score + x/count
    y >= (low-score + x/count) /x / (1+1/count)

    ugh.  nvm.
    Need to fill in all scores from lowest up.
