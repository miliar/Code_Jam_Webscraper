# Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek

"""
Tic-Tac-Toe-Tomek is a game played on a 4 x 4 square board. 
The board starts empty, except that a single 'T' symbol may 
appear in one of the 16 squares. There are two players: X and O. 
They take turns to make moves, with X starting. In each move 
a player puts her symbol in one of the empty squares. 
Player X's symbol is 'X', and player O's symbol is 'O'.

After a player's move, if there is a row, column or a diagonal 
containing 4 of that player's symbols, or containing 3 of her 
symbols and the 'T' symbol, she wins and the game ends. 
Otherwise the game continues with the other player's move. 
If all of the fields are filled with symbols and nobody won, 
the game ends in a draw. See the sample input for examples of 
various winning positions.
