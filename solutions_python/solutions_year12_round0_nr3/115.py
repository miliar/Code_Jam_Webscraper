""" 
Let's say a pair of distinct positive integers (n, m) is recycled if you
can obtain m by moving some digits from the back of n to the front without
changing their order. For example, (12345, 34512) is a recycled pair since you
can obtain 34512 by moving 345 from the end of 12345 to the front. Note that n
and m must have the same number of digits (excluding leading zeros) in order
to be a recycled pair.

Given integers A and B with the same number of digits, how many distinct
recycled pairs (n, m) are there with A <= n < m <= B?
