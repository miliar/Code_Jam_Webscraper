# O_i: the original sequence that is all 'L' except one 'G' at i-th tile.
# F_i: final artwork from O_i (with complexity C)
# We only need to consider cases of {C_i}_{0 <= i < K}.
#   Necessity: obvious;
#   Sufficiency: any original pattern with 'G' at j-th tile must have 'G'
#                anywhere F_j has 'G'.
# F_i has 'G' at j-th tile iff j, written in base K with C digits, has digit i.
#   Let c' be the index of i's first occrence (left to right) in j (base K). Then
#   the triangle that contains this 'G' starts at complexity level c'.
#   Notice j, written in base K, has C digits.
