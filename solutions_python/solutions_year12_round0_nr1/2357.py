I use in first place the script Googlerese.py to generate the googlerese mappings.

The one letter missing in googlerese was 'z'. I check that in english was 'q', then I completed the mapping and used later in ProblemA.py

PD: Sorry for my english :( ... I promise learn more (and googlerese too ^_^ )
