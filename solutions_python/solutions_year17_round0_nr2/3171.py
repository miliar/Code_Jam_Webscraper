    Problem B. Tidy Numbers
    
    * Problem
    Tatiana likes to keep things tidy. Her toys are sorted from smallest to largest,
    her pencils are sorted from shortest to longest and her computers from oldest to newest.
    One day, when practicing her counting skills, she noticed that some integers, when
    written in base 10 with no leading zeroes, have their digits sorted in non-decreasing
    order. Some examples of this are 8, 123, 555, and 224488. She decided to call these
    numbers tidy. Numbers that do not have this property, like 20, 321, 495 and 999990,
    are not tidy.
    She just finished counting all positive integers in ascending order from 1 to N. What
    was the last tidy number she counted?

    * Input
    The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line
    describes a test case with a single integer N, the last number counted by Tatiana.
    * Output
    For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number
    (starting from 1) and y is the last tidy number counted by Tatiana.
    
    * Limits
    1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
    Small dataset: 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.
    Large dataset: 1 ≤ N ≤ 1018.

    * Sample
    Input               Output 
    4
    132                 Case #1: 129
    1000                Case #2: 999
    7                   Case #3: 7
    111111111111111110  Case #4: 99999999999999999
    Note that the last sample case would not appear in the Small dataset.
