# Google Code Jam 2017. Round 1B
# Problem A. Steed 2: Cruise Control
#
# * Problem
# Annie is a bus driver with a high-stress job.She tried to unwind by going on
# a Caribbean cruise, but that also turned out to be stressful, so she has
# recently taken up horseback riding.
# Today, Annie is riding her horse to the east along a long and narrow one-way
# road that runs west to east. She is currently at kilometer 0 of the road, and
# her destination is at kilometer D; kilometers along the road are numbered
# from west to east.
# There are N other horses traveling east on the same road; all of them will go
# on traveling forever, and all of them are currently between Annie's horse and
# her destination. The i-th of these horses is initially at kilometer Ki and is
# traveling at its maximum speed of Si kilometers per hour.
# Horses are very polite, and a horse H1 will not pass (move ahead of) another
# horse H2 that started off ahead of H1. (Two or more horses can share the same
# position for any amount of time; you may consider the horses to be single
# points.) Horses (other than Annie's) travel at their maximum speeds, except
# that whenever a horse H1 catches up to another slower horse H2, H1 reduces
# its speed to match the speed of H2.
# Annie's horse, on the other hand, does not have a maximum speed and can
# travel at any speed that Annie chooses, as long as it does not pass another
# horse. To ensure a smooth ride for her and her horse, Annie wants to choose
# a single constant "cruise control" speed for her horse for the entire trip,
# from her current position to the destination, such that her horse will not
# pass any other horses. What is the maximum such speed that she can choose?
#
# * Input
# The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T; T test cases
# follow. Each test case begins with two integers D and N: the destination
# position of all of the horses(in kilometers) and the number of other horses
# on the road. Then, N lines follow. The i - th of those lines has two integers
# Ki and Si: the initial position (in kilometers) and maximum speed (in
# kilometers per hour) of the i - th of the other horses on the road.
#
# * Output
# For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the
# test case number (starting from 1) and y is the maximum constant speed (in
# kilometers per hour) that Annie can use without colliding with other horses.
# y will be considered correct if it is within an absolute or relative error of
# 10^-6 of the correct answer. See the FAQ for an explanation of what that
# means, and what formats of real numbers we accept.
#
# * Limits
# 1 ≤ T ≤ 100.
# 0 < Ki < D ≤ 10^9, for all i.
# Ki ≠ Mj, for all i ≠ j. (No two horses start in the same position.)
# 1 ≤ Si ≤ 10000.
# Small dataset: 1 ≤ N ≤ 2.
# Large dataset: 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000.
#
# * Sample
# Input     Output
# 3         Case #1: 101.000000
# 2525 1    Case #2: 100.000000
# 2400 5    Case #3: 33.333333
# 300 2
# 120 60
# 60 90
# 100 2
# 80 100
# 70 10
# In sample case #1, there is one other (very slow!) horse on the road; it
# will reach Annie's destination after 25 hours. Anything faster than 101
# kilometers per hour would cause Annie to pass the horse before reaching
# the destination.
# In sample case #2, there are two other horses on the road. The faster horse
# will catch up to the slower horse at kilometer 240 after 2 hours. Both horses
# will then go at the slower horse's speed for 1 more hour, until the horses
# reach Annie's destination at kilometer 300. The maximum speed that Annie can
# choose without passing another horse is 100 kilometers per hour.
