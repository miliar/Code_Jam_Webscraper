# 2^n = 8^n = +/- 1 (mod 3) and 4^n = +/- 1 (mod 5)
# and 6^n = +/- 1 (mod 7) and 10^n = +/- 1 (mod 11)
# => same no. of ones on even and odd powers
#
# 3^n, 5^n, 7^n = 1 (mod 2) => Even no. of 1s
#
# Therefore, of the remaining 1s that we can select, it is sufficient to select
# the same number of ones on even and odd powers to form a valid jamcoin with
# the given divisors. (n is known to be even, this is important)
