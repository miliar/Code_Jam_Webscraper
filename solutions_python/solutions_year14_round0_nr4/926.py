"""Google Code Jam Qualification Round 2014 Problem D. Deceitful War
https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/2974486/dashboard#s=p3
Naomi and Ken sometimes play games together. Before they play, each of them gets N identical-looking blocks of wood with masses between 0.0kg and 1.0kg (exclusive). All of the blocks have different weights. There are lots of games they could play with those blocks, but they usually play something they call War. Here is how War works:"""
