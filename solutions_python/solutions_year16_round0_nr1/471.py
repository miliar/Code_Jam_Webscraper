##When do we get insomnia?  (Avoid infinite loop)
##The only case is zero.
## Proof:
##   If integer N>0 has K digits, then for each symbol s
##   There are 10**K consecutive numbers with K+1 digits and symbol s as the first digit
##   At least one of these must be a multiple of N, since 10**K > N and multiples are spaced by N
## So we can simply set aside 0, the rest have answers
## Also, all K+1 digit numbers are < 100 * N, so we can use 100 as a maximum multiplier

## I don't notice a firm indication that N is always positive...
## Easy to handle negative N anyway
## Never mind, 0<N<10**6 excludes negative numbers
