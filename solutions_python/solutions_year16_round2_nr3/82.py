    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        An undirected bipartite graph.
    matching_algorithm : function
        A function that returns a maximum cardinality matching in a
        given bipartite graph. The function must take one input, the
        graph ``G``, and return a dictionary mapping each node to its

    -------
    min_cover : set
        It contains all the edges of minimum edge cover

    Notes
    -----
    An edge cover of a graph is a set of edges such that every node of
    the graph is incident to at least one edge of the set.
    The minimum edge cover is an edge covering of smallest cardinality.
    Due to its implementation, the worst-case running time of this algorithm
    is bounded by the worst-case running time of the function
    ``matching_algorithm``.
    Minimum edge cover for bipartite graph can also be found using the
    function present in :mod:`networkx.algorithms.bipartite.covering`
