//ok, we have to guess the strategies
//for War :
//Ken will always play the one just above, except if he can't then he plays his lowest
//has Naomi any strategy at all ? maybe not, we can try to consider that no, i feel like no
//so we can compute it easily
//for DWar :
//If Naomi wants Ken to play mass mk and win, she will tell mass mk-epsilon
//And in that case Naomi always plays her lowest mass
//So Naomi always plays her lowest mass to remove Ken's highest mass
//or (if she wants to win) she can always tell the truth (or Ken's lowest plus epsilon but no interest)
//not only ! if she has anything higher than Ken's lowest, she can tell more than Ken's highest and win
//est-ce que ca revient pas a reverse les roles ??
//what can Naomi do ? lose her lowest against the highest, win Ken's lowest against her closest high
//Ken can do that when i) Naomi plays her highest ii) Naomi plays her lowest
//if it's irrelevant whether Naomi plays that or differently, it means 
//let's see sur les exemples

//comment on fait pour War ? on trie les deux listes et on fait jouer N par ordre d√©croissant ou whatever

//seems to work sur les exemples
