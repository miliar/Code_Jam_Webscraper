# Code_Jam_Webscraper
## A scraper for getting all the correct solutions to all the [Google Code Jam](https://code.google.com/codejam/) contest problems.
The scraper is using [this Site](https://www.go-hero.net/jam/17) for collecting the files using multiprocessing.
You can specify in config.py language, years and savepath of the correct solutions you want to download.
To start the scraper, use the jupyter file main.ipynb.To check if everything worked as planned, have a look at the log file afterwards.
